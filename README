== Using Scad.hs ==

scad.hs provides a node hierarchy for constructive solid geometry. The main data type is a Node, which represents either a primitive geometry or an operation on other nodes. 

Currently, any node hierarchy can be rendered into OpenScad code using the "show" function. Eventually, the objective would be to interface directly with OpenSCAD/CGAL to create CGAL geometries and render to STL and other formats.
