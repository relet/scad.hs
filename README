== Using Scad.hs ==

scad.hs provides a node hierarchy for constructive solid geometry. The main data type is a Node, which represents either a primitive geometry or an operation on other nodes. 

Currently, any node hierarchy can be rendered into OpenScad code using the "show" function. 
Hierarchies consisting solely of Polyhedra can also be rendered directly to STL using 
> writeFile filename $ toStl node
(Support for most primitives and operations is in progress)
